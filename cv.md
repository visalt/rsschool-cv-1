I am Vitalii Saltan
My telephone number: 380661661399

I work as a copywriter, but I want to change my activity profile. My hobbies are: football, travel, historical films. I have a special love for travel, before the pandemic I visited 25 countries. 

At the moment I only own HTML & CSS.

Studying at RS school is my first experience in programming.

I graduated from the Kirovograd National Technical University with a degree in Computer Engineering.

My English is at a basic level, but I plan to start learning it soon.
